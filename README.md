### Project Introduction:
Drug overdose deaths in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and 2017, then reversed slightly in 2018. Two-thirds of drug overdose deaths involve opioids (prescription opioids, heroin and illegal fentanyl). Ways to reduce overdoses include safer prescribing, expanded treatment for people with opioid use disorder (OUD), and harm reduction programs (e.g., naloxone distribution). Each needs a strategy to identify high-need populations, but policies often operate without a comprehensive understanding of the risks associated with the entire community.
In this project, we will estimate a geospatial risk prediction model, predicting overdoses as a function of environmental factors.
